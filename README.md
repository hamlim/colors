# Colors

Colors is a simple css repo including hex color codes for several popular color sets and a few personal color resources.

# Folders / Color Sets:

* Material Design
* Flat UI
* matts_faves [A personal collection of colors I am a fan of]


# Uses

Ideally one could simply grab the `variables.css` files from whatever color set they want and include the file into their css in order to use the colors.
